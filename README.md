# QuidaxAssessment
This repo contains the cypress automation script submitted as part of the requirements for the Quidax QA Engineer role.

## INSTALLING CYPRESS
- Create a folder on your local machine where you want to install cypress
- Then, install cypress in that folder by running the following command in the terminal
### "npm install cypress --save-dev"
(You should have node and npm installed already. If not, just download and install node and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Open the folder in your preferred text editor (VS Code or any other of your choice)
- Now that we have Cypress installed, we can launch it with:
 ### "npx cypress open"
- Click on the “E2E Testing” button on the left to get started
- Select the browser you want to run the tests with and click "Start E2E Testing"
_* NB: If this is your first time running Cypress, you should click create a new empty spec. This creates a sample test script for you that you can run to test that cypress works.

## RUNNING THE TEST
- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Open the folder in any code editor of your choice (I hope VS Code is your preferred choice)
- Open the terminal and run the command
  ### npx cypress open
- Select E2E in the cypress runner that opens
- Select your preferred browser
- Select the "Quidax" file to run the tests
